    // If you need to add an OS, do the following steps:
    //     Update NativeConstants.cs with the new OS version/build numbers
    //     Add it to the OperatingSystemVersion enumeration (Congrats, you're here already!)
    //     Create the appropriate managed functions in VersionHelper.cs
    //     Detect your freshly minted OS!
