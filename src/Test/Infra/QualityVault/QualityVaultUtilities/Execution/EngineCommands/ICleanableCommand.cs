    /// This provides a high reliabilty contract for commands in Test Execution Engine.

    /// It provides following Benefits:
    /// 1- Actions are cleaned up after test execution has occurred.
    /// 2- Actions get cleaned up in reverse order of application.
    /// 3- Cleanup operations get Exception containment - meaning, if they ---- up, they don't break everything else, but do get logged.
    /// 
    /// Note: We intentionally don't provide an Apply command. Commands should provide a static initializer which creates the rollback 
    ///         command and applies the operation. Present thinking is that it is better for the initializer to fail, and not 
    ///         provide a useless rollback, than to provide a rollback which is going to be attempted, regardless of success of apply.
