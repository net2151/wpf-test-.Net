    ///     messages that arrive.  The delegate has a slightly different
    ///     signature than a WNDPROC to be more specific about whether the
    ///     message was handled or not.  If the message was not handled by the
    ///     delegate, this class passes the message on down the WNDPROC chain.

    ///     1) Create an instance of the HwndSubclass class and pass the delegate
    ///        to the constructor.
